# Node Modules Management storage

## Description

This project is created to address the issue faced by developers working with node_modules, where the computer or laptop used has limited storage capacity. Due to the large size of node_modules per project, this can be very inconvenient for developers. With this program, we hope to be able to locate and determine the size of scattered node modules in various locations. With this information, it is expected to assist developers in managing their project's node_modules, allowing them to better manage their storage availability.
